        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <div className="vision-content">
          <p>
          PodVerse is a final-year diploma project developed at Shri Bhagubhai Mafatlal Polytechnic with the aim of democratizing podcast creation using AI technologies. It simplifies content production through features like voice cloning, text-to-podcast, and audio enhancement, enabling users from all backgrounds to easily share their stories and ideas.

        <h2>Our Motivation</h2>
        <div className="idea-content">
          <p>
            Inspired by advancements in AI such as NotebookLM and similar applications, 
            we saw an opportunity to create a platform that removes the technical barriers 
            to podcast creation. Many people have valuable insights and stories but lack the 
            equipment, technical knowledge, or confidence to start a podcast. PodVerse 
            aims to change that by providing intuitive AI-powered tools that simplify the 
            entire process.
